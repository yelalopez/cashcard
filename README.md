# CashCard

A Family CashCard Service developed at Spring Academy. This app allows families to manage digital debit cards.

By building this service from start to finish, I learned about REST APIs, basic Spring Security, data persistence, and modern application development.

We implemented test-driven development.
We used Spring Security to authenticate and authorize the application.
We built a fully functional REST API with Spring Boot.
We automatically converted database records to Java objects using Spring Data JDBC.
